# Features that still need work

Derived from the verified use-case review of the current build. Ordered by how ready each group is
to be worked on, not by importance.

---

## 1. Known defects

None currently open. Every defect found in this round has been fixed — see *Recently closed*.

## 2. Built but not yet exercised live

Nothing outstanding — every feature has now been exercised against the live database.

## 3. Partially built

Nothing outstanding — A8 was the last item here and is now delivered.

## 4. Open observations — not yet investigated

| Observation | Why it matters |
|---|---|
| The passport rendered **two identical "Player of the Week" entries** | Either duplicate rows in `recognition_awards` or a render duplication. Recognition is permanent and shown on the passport, so duplicates are visible to players |
| ~~A U11s squad exists in the data~~ — **resolved, and it was not what it looked like** | The "U11s" was a coach's free-text `team` label, not an `age_group` value. Every `squad_players.age_group` is NULL, so no sub-U13 data ever existed. The real defect was `CoachAddPlayer` carrying its own U7–U19+ list separate from `AGE_GROUPS`, which would eventually have produced exactly that data. Fixed — the screen now reads the shared constant. **Decision: the range starts at U13** |

## 5. Not built — the character feature

The athlete's only active role, and the reason for a child to open the app between matches.
Content is gated on the sports psychologist review.

| | Feature | Persona |
|---|---|---|
| A13 | Per-session moment: learn (flashcard) → apply (scenario) → act (challenge) | Athlete |
| A14 | Growth view: values shown, streaks, season progress | Athlete |
| N2 | Character corner on the player card — separate axis, never merged into the performance band | Athlete |
| C13 | Coach sees a player's character progress | Coach |
| — | Content library: values × age band × tier, plus the weekly value rotation | — |

## 6. Not built — required before real users or revenue

| | Feature |
|---|---|
| N3 | Terms of service and privacy policy |
| N3 | Parental consent capture — age gating, versioning, audit trail |
| N4 | Billing: payments, plans, subscription state, invoices, failed-payment handling |
| — | Data export for GDPR portability (account deletion already exists) |

## 7. Deliberately deferred

| Feature | Note |
|---|---|
| Parents see the coach's private note | Kept player-only on purpose. Reopen only if you decide otherwise |
| P6 → parent view of coach assessments | Now delivered; the private note remains excluded |
| Multi-sport — rugby, basketball | Needs the football pack proven first |
| School / academy roles | Parked with the schools direction |

## 8. Technical work that is not a feature but blocks launch

| Item | Current state |
|---|---|
| Test coverage | 7 test files against 163 source files |
| RLS security review | **Done.** Full pass completed — see *Security review* below |
| PWA manifest / install experience | **Done** (`18b2fa4`). Manifest, icon set and Apple touch icon added — Trak installs to the home screen and opens standalone |
| Backups | Restore never tested |
| Bundle size | Build warns on chunks over 500 kB |
| Coach friction | **Partly done.** Quick Assess fixed (`a282d34`). Match logging and add-player not yet measured |

---

## Shortest path

There are no open defects. What remains is genuine build work, and the two largest pieces — the
character feature and the legal/billing layer — are gated on the psychologist and lawyer
conversations rather than on engineering.

Both product questions are now settled — age groups start at U13, and `player_goals` is dropped.
The coach friction audit is now complete for match logging and add-player (see above) — **not yet
verified live**. Next most valuable: test coverage, untested backups, bundle size, and the absolute
`og:image` URL once the production domain is known.

## Security review — completed

A full authorization pass was run against the live database, signed in as each role.

**Read isolation: clean.** Anonymous users can read **zero rows** from every table. A player sees
only their own records; a coach sees only their own squad and assessments, nothing from the other
two coaches in the academy; a parent probed against **ten other children's** squad rows returned
zero assessments and zero awards.

**Write authorization: one serious flaw, now fixed** (`bf74447`). Every write policy on
coach-owned tables read `WITH CHECK (coach_user_id = auth.uid())` — which asks *"are you claiming
to be yourself?"* but never *"are you a coach?"*. Signed in as an ordinary player it was possible
to:

- insert a coach assessment with 10/10 in every category about oneself — feeding the band,
  Evolution Card, passport, parent view and club dashboard
- award oneself Player of the Week
- insert coach sessions, calendar events and squad players
- create an organization with oneself as admin

Because `coach_assessments` and `recognition_awards` deliberately have no DELETE policy, the
fabricated rows could not be removed through the app either.

Fixed by requiring the writer to actually hold the role (`is_coach()`, `is_club_admin()`) on every
INSERT and UPDATE. Verified afterwards that all six attacks are blocked, that coaches can still
assess, award, create sessions and events and add players, and that a player joining by invite
code still works (that path is `SECURITY DEFINER` and unaffected).

`get_profile_role(uuid)` was also narrowed to the caller. It was **not** dropped despite appearing
unused in the app: it is what the "users can update own profile" policy relies on to stop a user
promoting themselves to coach.

> **Why code review would not have caught this:** `coach_user_id = auth.uid()` reads like a correct
> ownership check. It only failed when the write was actually attempted from the wrong account.

## Coach friction — the business risk being worked

The business model matrix names **"coach stops logging"** as the single biggest threat to the
product: the coach does all the work, is usually unpaid, and if the routine takes more than a
couple of minutes it stops by week three. If the coach stops, there is nothing for the player,
parent or club to see.

**Measured and fixed:** Quick Assess reset all six sliders to the midpoint for every player —
about **108 precise drags** to get through an 18-player squad on a phone. It also invited bad
data, since tapping *Next* without touching anything recorded a real "Mixed 5.0" assessment
indistinguishable from a considered one. Sliders now start from that player's previous
assessment, so the coach moves only what changed. No extra query: the scores were already being
fetched and discarded.

**Measured and fixed — match logging (`CoachQuickMatchLog`):**
- Attendance defaulted to nobody selected, even though "everyone who showed up played" is the
  common case — the coach had to tap every attendee instead of deselecting the rare absentee.
  Now defaults to the whole squad selected.
- **Silent failure, unverified live:** neither the `session_attendance` insert nor the per-player
  `log_match_for_player` RPC calls checked their `error` result — a failed write still showed
  "Match logged." Now both are checked and a failure surfaces as a toast naming how many player
  records didn't save, rather than a false success.
- 18 sequential `await`s (one RPC call per linked player) replaced with `Promise.all`, so a full
  squad no longer waits on 18 round-trips one at a time.
- Not verified live — no Supabase credentials were available in this session. Needs exercising
  against the real database, same as every other item in this document, before being trusted.

**Measured, no fix needed — add-player (`CoachAddPlayer`):** already minimal — name, one position
tap, one age-group tap, optional shirt number, save. No meaningful friction found.

**Not yet measured:** nothing remaining in this pair.

### Recently closed

- **Quick Assess friction** — sliders start from the player's last assessment instead of the
  midpoint (`a282d34`). Verified live.
- **Age groups single-sourced** — `CoachAddPlayer` carried its own U7–U19+ list while signup used
  the shared constant. **Decision: the range starts at U13** (`aa446c0`).
- **`player_goals` dropped** — the table behind the removed goals feature. Nothing read it; removed
  rather than left dormant because it is children's data that would otherwise need declaring
  (`a1f957d`).

- **PWA install experience** — Trak can now be added to a home screen and opens without browser
  chrome (`18b2fa4`). Share previews also fixed: the Open Graph image pointed at a stale Lovable
  screenshot. **One follow-up:** `og:image` is still relative, and social platforms need an
  absolute URL — it must be set to the production domain before invite links preview correctly.

- **P4 parent alerts** — verified live and extended with recognition awards as a third alert type,
  using the parent read access added in `20260612000001`.

- **A8 parent invite delivery** — built (`5c91efe`). Players can now share an invite link from
  their profile; previously a parent was only linked by coincidence of using the exact address.

- **P5** — parent access to coach assessments and awards. Migration `20260612000001`, applied.
- **Housekeeping** — `MatchLog.tsx` and `CoachProgress.tsx` deleted as orphaned and unreferenced.
- **Verification sweep** — C9 recognition, C10 schedule, C11 AI assistant, A7 passport and K6 club
  radar all exercised live against the database. **None was silently broken** — the P5 pattern did
  not repeat. C11 proved stronger than documented: it is squad-aware and renders pitch diagrams.
- **K5 club dashboard** — showed "TOTAL PLAYERS 1" above squads summing to 29, because the headline
  counted linked accounts while the squads counted roster rows. Fixed (`3bd1507`).
- **Passport horizontal overflow** — fixed (`866949a`); the card now scales to fit while the PNG
  export keeps its full 390px geometry.
- **Dev seed duplication** — the whole seed is now idempotent (`14976b2`, `42e43c3`).
- **Signup password policy** — client rules did not match Supabase, so realistic passwords were
  rejected with a raw character-set dump. Fixed (`fd1a30e`).
- **End-to-end chain verified** — coach → player → parent created from scratch; invite-code linking,
  squad membership and parent linking all confirmed against the live database.
